Techspardha is the national level inter-collegiate technical and entrepreneurship festival organized every year by National Institute of Technology, Kurukshetra. Since its humble inception in 1995 as Literati (as it was formerly called) with the noble goal of enhancing the technical aptitude and scientific acumen of students, Techspardha has witnessed tremendous growth with an annual footfall of over 6000 students from all over India.
Etymologically, the word ‘Techspardha’ is composed of two words, ‘Tech’ in English which is a contraction for technology and ‘Spardha’ in Hindi means competition. Thus, it signifies technological empowerment through healthy concurs and tournaments.
